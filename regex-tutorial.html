					<p>Hello! My name is Sarah and I love podcasts, watching movies with my husband and playing with my
					two cats, Ralph and Maggie.</p>
					
					<p>I have been working in the eCommerce space since graduating college back in 2017. I've learned a lot in that time, most of which includes learning how to increase and maintain profitability, leading the buildout of multiple Shopify storefronts, creating a successful Amazon Proseller account and mentoring a team of exceptional employees.</p>
					
					<p>Recently though, I've decided to pivot my career by pursuing a career in web developement. Web development is something I've been interested in since taking one college class many years ago. I'm excited to start a new journey where I can problem solve on a daily basis and foster creativity in my work.</p>
